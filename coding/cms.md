# Content Management System

A **content management system** (CMS) is software that helps businesses manage and organize digital content. CMSs can be used to create, edit, organize, and publish content. They can also help keep content organized and accessible so it can be used and repurposed effectively.

On a more technical level, a content management system is made up of two core parts:

- A **content management application** (CMA) – this is the part that allows you to actually add and manage content on your site (like you saw above).
- A **content delivery application** (CDA) – this is the backend, behind-the-scenes process that takes the content you input in the CMA, stores it properly, and makes it visible to your visitors.
Together, the two systems make it easy to maintain your website.
